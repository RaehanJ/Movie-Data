# Overview
In today's society, streaming platforms have become a worldwide trend in mainstream media, where a good majority of people have owned at least one subscription in their day-to-day lives. Whether it is from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Disney+, there are a boatload of streaming platforms catered to every audience member's demographic and personal preferences. This project explores the thousands of movies and TV shows available across said platforms and how age demographics, specific actors, genres, and the actual amount of content comes into play using the particular coding techniques we have discussed throughout the course. Some techniques covered include, but are not limited to, hypothesis testing, tackling the dplyr package, and data visualization. 
# GOALS
The goal of our project is to discover which platforms provide content geared towards specific age groups or are content heavy in one specific genre, discover which platforms would be best fit for a person that prefers access to more movies or TV shows, and if the actors in movies leads to a better IMDb score. We felt that streaming platforms and movies play such a huge role in the lives of so many people in today's society and is very relatable and well understood by many. The questions that we answered in this project were ones that we specifically were interested in which was also a huge motivation for us since it was an enjoyable topic to look into, and we felt that it could help many others when trying to answer these same questions when deciding which streaming platform to purchase a subscription to.
# WHY
We felt this topic is a very current one that can affect most people especially around our age. When we were discussing what to research we realized that we have never taken the time to really dive in and make an informed decision when it came to having a streaming platform subscription. Rather we realized we were just buying so many different ones without really looking at the overlaps and dissimilarities of each platform and what we truly wanted out of a streaming service. Once we realized that we had never looked deeply into our subscriptions we realized so many others were out there just like us, so we chose to finally buckle down and find answers to questions that would help us make a more informed decision about our streaming subscriptions.
# OUTLINE

Questions we have answered:

1.Do the streaming platforms gear their content towards a certain age group more than others?

2.Does an "A list" actor always guarantee a higher rating on IMDb? Do some platforms have more content with "A list" actors?

3.Are movies and TV shows always improving its quality through the time? (See average rate from two platforms by year)

4.Do certain platforms contain more movies in specific genres than other genres?

5.Do certain streaming platforms have more movies vs tv shows or vice versa?
