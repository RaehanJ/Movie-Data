# Movie-Data
In today's society, streaming platforms have become a worldwide trend in mainstream media, where a good majority of people have owned at least one subscription in their day-to-day lives. Whether it is from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Disney+, there are a boatload of streaming platforms catered to every audience member's demographic and personal preferences. This project explores the thousands of movies and TV shows available across said platforms and how age demographics, specific actors, genres, and the actual amount of content comes into play using the particular coding techniques we have discussed throughout the course. Some techniques covered include, but are not limited to, hypothesis testing, tackling the dplyr package, and data visualization.
